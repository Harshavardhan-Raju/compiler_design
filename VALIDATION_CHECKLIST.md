# Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to verify that all components of the C Compiler Execution Path Visualizer are working correctly.

---

## Build Validation

### Compiler Build
- [ ] `make clean` executes without errors
- [ ] `make` builds successfully
- [ ] `mycc.exe` (Windows) or `mycc` (Linux/Mac) is created
- [ ] No compilation warnings (or only expected warnings)
- [ ] Binary has execute permissions (Linux/Mac)

### File Verification
```bash
# Check if binary exists
ls -la mycc.exe  # Windows
ls -la mycc      # Linux/Mac

# Verify size (should be > 100KB)
# Windows: dir mycc.exe
# Linux/Mac: ls -lh mycc
```

## Command Line Validation

### Help Flag
- [ ] `./mycc -h` displays help message
- [ ] All flags are documented: `-p`, `-a`, `-s`, `-i`, `-t`, `-h`

**Expected output:**
```
Usage: mycc [options] <source-file>
Options:
  -p    Parse and display tokens
  -a    Generate and display AST
  -s    Perform semantic analysis
  -i    Interpret and execute
  -t    Trace execution (with JSON output)
  -h    Display this help message
```

### Parse Flag (`-p`)
- [ ] `./mycc -p test_simple_vars.c` shows tokens
- [ ] Token output includes: INT, IDENTIFIER, NUMBER, etc.
- [ ] No syntax errors for valid code

### AST Flag (`-a`)
- [ ] `./mycc -a test_simple_vars.c` generates JSON
- [ ] JSON is valid (can be parsed)
- [ ] AST contains expected nodes: Program, Function, Decl, etc.

**Validation:**
```bash
./mycc -a test_simple_vars.c | python -m json.tool
```

### Semantic Analysis (`-s`)
- [ ] `./mycc -s test_simple_vars.c` runs analysis
- [ ] Reports type errors correctly
- [ ] Reports undefined variables
- [ ] Reports redeclaration errors

### Interpretation (`-i`)
- [ ] `./mycc -i test_simple_vars.c` executes code
- [ ] Produces correct output
- [ ] Variables are initialized correctly
- [ ] Control flow works (if, while, for)
- [ ] Functions can be called
- [ ] Recursion works

### Trace Flag (`-t`)
- [ ] `./mycc -t test_trace.c` generates TRACE output
- [ ] Each line starts with "TRACE " or is valid JSON
- [ ] Trace includes: step, type, block, line, variables
- [ ] Variables are tracked correctly
- [ ] Control flow is traced (enter/exit blocks)

**Expected trace format:**
```json
TRACE {"step":1,"type":"enter","block":"function","line":1}
TRACE {"step":2,"type":"execute","block":"declaration","line":2,"content":"int x","variables":{"x":5}}
```
